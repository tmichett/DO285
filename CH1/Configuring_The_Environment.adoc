== Configuring the Classroom Environment - DEMO

Before configuring the classroom environment you must first setup and configure Github and Quay.IO accounts.

.Account Creation
[TIP]
====
The Github account creation steps are in Appendix A, while the Quay.IO account creation steps a located in Appendix B. It is best and easiest if you configure the Quay.IO account to rely on username and password. Additionally, if you've configured Github account to have two-factor (2FA) authentication you will need to setup the SSH config file to leverage the proper SSH keys and ID for the Github account.
