=== Provisioning Containerized Services - DEMO

The following demonstration will show how to use the Universal Base Image (UBI) for RHEL8. I will allow you to see various *podman* commands in action that were demonstrated throughout the chapter. There will be a few new commands that are introduced as well.

.Getting an Interactive Shell
[TIP]
====
When running a container, it is possible to pass *-it* as a command line option and then specify an interactive shell such as */bin/bash*
====

. Verify that you are running the container and accessing the container shell.

.Failure of *systemd* and *httpd* as a Daemon

Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service.

.Containers and Services as Daemons
[IMPORTANT]
====
The container is running, but isn't a full blown virtual machine. Therefore, the systemd functionality and init system isn't running on a back-end. For apache to run, you can use specialized HTTPD containers. In order to run for this container, you will need to use *httpd &* to run the service in the background.

.Container Management
[CAUTION]
====
Stopped containers don't appear as running. Stopped containers can be seen with the *podman ps -a* command. It is possible to launch/start a stopped container with the *podman start* command, but you must provide the container name/ID in order to start the container. The *podman exec* command will allow a command to be executed interactively in the container.

It is good practice to cleanup containers and images that are no longer needed.
